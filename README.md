Hieraviz
===============

Hieraviz is a simple web application for accessing Puppet development code and production data in a unified interface. Its main goal is to enable a better visibility on the Puppet architecture for more actors to be able to interact with it.

It's currently in very early stages of development, use at your own risk.

Installation 
-------------------
Install it from Rubygens:

    gem install hieraviz

Usage
